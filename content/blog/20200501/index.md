Hey guys, I'm Tomoya.  
Just decided to start off this blog to output what I learn and think about things(mainly programming stuffs) on a daily basis.

As this is the first post of this blog, the three things that I'd love to write about are as follows:

1. Why I decided to start this blog (Why)
2. The rules I impose on myself (How)
3. What I am going to write about (What)

1 . **Why I decided to start this blog**

I made this blog because I wanted to brush up both English and Japanese writing skills and also output what I learn and think about from a variety of engineering fields such as System Engineer, Web Developer, and many other kinds. (Right now I'm on job hunting so I don't know what kind of engineer I would be...)

The other day, an attractive IT company gave me the opportunity for the final interview along with a task below.

> Decide three goals for a year from now, and propose specific ways to achieve them before the interview.

I'm not really sure if I can actually get into the company, however, I believe this task is a worthwhile to tackle whether I can pass the interview or not.

Then, the first thing came up in my head was maintaining and even improving my English writing (Japanese as well). And I thought this blog can effectively help me output what I learn as engineer at the same time.

So I will make this blog something I can recall what I've learned in the past or I can take some notes for future on. Course I'd love to make it easy for everyone who reads this but since this blog is built for a completely personal purpose, I kindly ask for your understandings if the posts are not what you want to read.

2 . **The rules I impose on myself**

I will not make strict rules for this blogging because I once gave up blogging with Wordpress site due to the strict rules like how many posts to write per a week and so on.

Therefore, I made three easy rules below.

 - Write a post in both English and Japanese
 - Don't spend too much time on blogging. Engineering comes first.
 - Stop thinking about how to make it easier for others to read.

I'd really love to keep this blog alive for long this time since I couldn't the last time I tried. So starting off with easy ones, I'll add some rules if I can really keep blogging with them.

3 . **What I am going to write about**

As this is my personal blog, I would post whatever I want to post if that works for me. The things I'm expecting to live on this blog are as follows:

 - tips, shortcuts, and useful plugins for daily coding
 - how I run into errors and the solutions for them
 - what I think about new technology and dev-trends
 - work experiences as a newbie engineer
 - etc..

Thank you for reading my first post.
I hope this blog will be something other engineers can gain some knowledge or motivation from. Stay awesome, guys!
