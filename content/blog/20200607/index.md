Hey guys, I'm Tomoya.
It's been a week since I got here in Tokyo and started working as an engineer. So today I'll write about What I've done on my job and how I feel about it.

### What I've done so far
I joined the project in which we reverse-engineer some OSS applications from foreign countries so that we sell them to Japanese companies. It's been run on test-server now, and I enter the server and fix bugs by using ssh. I've never ever touched PHP before but this time I've spent so much time on reading and understanding PHP codes.

Also, I did quite much translation on admin page of the OSS application. I translated over 2000  English words and sentences into Japanese past a few days. Actually I feel like my hands are a lot more exhausted than my head because I worked so hard on typing fast as much as translating quickly.

On Saturday though, I had a chance to join the meeting for a brand new IoT project, which was super exciting and meaningful. I voluntarily made a minute and I fully understood the concept and business plan of this new project now. It's wonderful that I learned not only engineer-related things but also how to sell service/product on this meeting.

### How I feel now
I feel like I've grown as an engineer blazing fast because my company gives me much more practical tasks than I ever expected I would be handling before getting into this company. At first, I thought it's almost impossible to debug PHP codes without any knowledge and experience of PHP. However, as my senior engineer does on daily basis, now I manage to figure out where a problem occurs and fix it right away. Even though I can't write a certain code of PHP, I find myself confidently reading a large amount of PHP codes these days.

And importantly, I'm so glad and honored to participate in such a great project in my company from now on. I can't tell what it is all about because it's the top confidential though. Anyway I'm so happy to work as an initial member of this project. I'll try my best to fully contribute to what this company's doing.

Honestly, I feel overwhelmed with all the stuff I have to do and what I should study for them. Also I'm under so much pressure and stress for my job right now and I can't focus on anything else like this blog or English study. If I made a rule like how many posts per week, then it would be extremely tough to keep this blog. I have so many things to study even in private time.

Having said that, I know I'm not such a smart person who can get used to engineering work and study in just a week. So at the end of the day I don't need to worry about this whole thing too much.

I'm not sure how long it takes to get used to what I do in current situation, and I don't know when I can post another one. However, still find it fun and meaningful to output what has been on my mind on this blog so I will post something again later on.

Thank you for reading! Cheers!
